/**
 * Created by subhransumishra on 6/24/16.
 * Problem: Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
 * Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume
 * that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is
 * monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.
 * It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.
 * Example:
 * Solution:
 * Complexity:
